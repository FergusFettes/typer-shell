# Typer Shell!

Beautiful command-line shell with [Typer](https://github.com/tiangolo/typer)!

This is just an update to [click-shell](https://github.com/clarkperkins/click-shell) for typer.

I also added some features like:
- better help by default
- support for typer default functions (just name one of your commands 'default' and it will be triggered when nothing else is recognized)
- easily drop into an ipython terminal with the local context loaded with 'shell'
- each shell can have local parameters with helper functions for loading and saving them from files
